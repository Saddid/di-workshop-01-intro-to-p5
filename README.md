# Workshop 1: Introducing JavaScript with P5.js

Collaborators: [your github username] & [your partners github username]

Make sure you‚Äôre working in pairs - on a single laptop. You‚Äôll be **pair
programming**. In pair programming, there are two roles - **driver** and
**navigator**.

The **driver** is at the keyboard. They‚Äôre responsible for typing and figuring
out syntax. They shouldn‚Äôt make decisions though! That‚Äôs the responsibility of
the **navigator**. They make decisions, and ask the driver to implement them.

Start by forking this repo:
![fork button](https://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/fork_button.jpg)

Forking creates a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account. Add your partner
as a collaborator by going to 'Settings' > 'Collaborators & teams' and entering
their GitHub username in the 'Collaborators' box. That means you'll both have
access to the repo.

You should now have a copy of this git repository in your own github account.
Now, we need to get a copy on our own laptop for us to work with. Start by
opening a terminal and creating a projects/ada folder if you don't already have
one:

```sh
cd Desktop
mkdir Projects
cd Projects
```

Next, we need to clone the repo. This copies all the files and history from
github to our own computer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/di-workshop-01-intro-to-p5.git
cd di-workshop-01-intro-to-p5
```

You can see that it's a git repository and some of the history by running these
commands:

```sh
git status
git log
```

> **Note:** If you get stuck in `git log`, it's because you're in something
> called a pager. This is a really old bit of software from before computers
> could scroll in the way we're used to. You can move up and down in the pager
> with your arrow keys, and exit it by pressing `q`

Finally, we need to install some bits and pieces that in our new repo to finish
setting it up:

```sh
npm install
```

We‚Äôll be working with some software called P5. P5 is a **JavaScript library**
for drawing shapes - it‚Äôs used for making simple games and cool generative art.

For each of the **bold** questions below:

<h3 align="center">
  üó£ Discuss &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üë©‚Äçüíª Change &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üëÄ Observe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üîÑ Repeat
</h3>

1. **üó£ Discuss** the question with your partner
1. **üë©‚Äçüíª Change the code** - what do you expect your changes to do?
1. **üëÄ Observe the results** - what happened when you ran your code? How did it
   differ from your expectations
1. **üîÑ Repeat** - keep discussing, changing, and running the code until you
   feel you understand it

**The aim of this workshop is _exploration_, hopefully leading to
_understanding_. It‚Äôs really important that you _take your time_. The questions
below are _guidelines_, meant to prompt your _curiosity_. If you can‚Äôt answer a
question, use a search engine or ask someone nearby. Don‚Äôt move on until you
_fully understand_ what‚Äôs happening.**

**Explore and have fun! Be curious!**

# Setup

Now you've got the repo cloned and installed, we need to start it up:

```sh
npm start
```

This runs a web server - a little program that your browser can connect to so
that the files you write in this project can run in there. Now, when you visit
http://localhost:5000/, you'll see all your files right there.

Open the workshop folder in your editor. In VSCode, choose File > Open and
select the folder - _not any of the files inside it_. You should see all the
workshop files in the left-hand file pane.

Open this file - README.md - in your editor. Make notes in here about everything
you do. If you don't know the answer to a question, it's your job to experiment
with the code to see what you can find out.

# Sketch A

Open the `part-a` sketch in your browser, and open `part-a/sketch.js` in your
editor. The code in `sketch.js` is what's running on the page. Every time you
make a change in `sketch.js`, you need to save the file (ctrl-S or cmd-S) and
refresh your web browser (ctrl-r or cmd-r) to see the change.

---

Look at these lines:

```js
var r = 255
var g = 80
var b = 0
```

**What might these lines do?**
it creates three variables and sets numbers 
**What happens if you change the numbers?**
the colour of the box changes
**What numbers are allowed / What numbers have an effect?**
Positive numbers up to 255
Look at this line:

```js
createCanvas(400, 400)
```

**What does createCanvas do?**
it determines the size of the shape
**What happens if you change the numbers?**
first number changes the width, second number changes the height
**What numbers are allowed/what numbers have an effect?**
Negative numbers make the shape disappear, but you can use any positive number
**What happens if you add/remove a number?**
removing a number gets rid of the shape, adding a numbe changes nothing

**Can you guess what the `function setup() {` part does? What happens if you
change the name of setup?** 

Look at this line:

```js
background(r, g, b)
```

**What does background do?**
The background sets the colour of the shape according to the values stored in the variables r,g and b.

**What happens if you change the order of the letters in background? What does
this tell you about how the computer uses them?**
This will change the colour. The computer does not associate a variable name with a type of input, so it just takes it in standard rgb order. 
**What happens if you change the number of letters?**
The colour of the box turns grey
**What happens if you change the letters for different ones?**
It gets rid of the box because there is no variables set up unde rthe new letters. The letters of the variables can be changed and not make any difference.
# Sketch B

Open the `part-b` sketch in your browser, and open `part-b/sketch.js` in your
editor.

Read the code and play with the sketch in your browser.

> **Note**: There's two main sections in the code - the bit called `setup` and
> the bit called `draw`. The code in the `setup` section runs **once**, when
> your program first starts up. The code in the `draw` section runs again and
> again and again - 60 times every second.

Look at these lines:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(0, 0, 0)
}
```

**What does setup do?**

**What do `{` `}` mean? What happens if you remove one?**
The Square dissapears. 
**What do the numbers in `background(0, 0, 0)` do? What happens when you change
them? How is this different from Sketch A?**

Now look at these lines:

```js
function draw() {
  fill(255, 0, 0)
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30)
}
```

**What does draw do?**

Now look at:

```js
fill(255, 0, 0)
```

**What do these numbers do? What happens when you change them?**
changes the colour of the circles
**What does fill mean? What happens if you change it to stroke?**
the colours in fill set the colour of the whole circle, whereas with stroke, it sets the colour of the outline.
**What happens if you remove (or comment out) this line? What about if you
include both fill and stroke on seperate lines?**
if yo include both on different lines it sets the fill colour and the outline colour
Now look at this line:

```js
ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30)
```

**What does `ellipse` do?**
 creates a shape at your current mouse position with a height and width as specified in the parentesis
**What happens if you change the numbers?**
it changed the shape of the circle. You can make it taller or fatter (oval)
**What do `mouseX` and `mouseY` mean?**
It is the mouse position X and Y value as if the canvas shape is a table/grid 
**What happens if you change the order of the items between the `(` `)`?**

---

**What happens if you add `background(0)` after `draw() {`? Why?**

Replace the ellipse with a triangle. Use https://p5js.org/reference/ (the 2D
primitives section) to help.

Play around with the sketch - how else can you change it?

# Sketch C

Open the `part-c` sketch in your browser, and open `part-c/sketch.js` in your
editor.

Read the code, then play with the sketch and observe what happens - try clicking
the mouse on the sketch.

Look at:

```js
if (mouseIsPressed) {
  fill(255, 0, 0)
} else {
  fill(0, 255, 0)
}
```

**What does `mouseIsPressed` mean?**
When the left button is clicked. 
**What happens if you change `mouseIsPressed` to `keyIsPressed`?** 
it changes the control to a key, so you can press any key to change the colour.
You‚Äôll need
to click on the sketch so it registers keyboard events ‚Äì use the ctrl key if you
have issues with the keyboard.

**What does if / else do?**
this gives the code a pathway
**What happens if you remove the { } or ( )? Why?**
the code doesnt work 
**What happens if you change 255 to mouseX ? Why?**

**Remove the outline of the circle. Use Google and the P5.js reference to help
you.**

# Challenge

In your pairs, take the code in sketch c and adapt it into a simple paint
program. The user should be able

- click and drag to paint on the screen
- press keys on the keyboard to choose a colour
  - e.g. pressing ‚Äòr‚Äô changes the paint colour to red, pressing ‚Äòg‚Äô changes the
    paint colour to green.

Use this code as a starting point:

```js
if (keyIsPressed) {
  if (key == 'r') {
    // set paint colour to red
  }
  if (key == 'g') {
    // set paint colour to green
  }
  // add more keys/colours
}
```

**Document your process in this file.**

## Extension

- Change the shape of the brush (explore other shapes like squares or triangles)
  based on a key pressed
- Change the size of the brush based on a key pressed.
